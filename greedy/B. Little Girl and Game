#solve example and graphic view

-

-> a b a
* First player got the palindrome so he will be
  the winner

-> a b c a

* First player remove the character b from this
  list
  this updated String is : a c a
* this is the palindrom string 
* so second player got the palindrome string
  so he will won the game

observations

-

*
*
* palindrome string's has same character to it's
  both corner
* even length palindrome has all the character
  same number of times, as example abba
* But if the palindrome is the odd length then
  a or some number of character is present at the
  middle. Other's corner is as like as the even
  length palindrome. eg : abcba, so their is any
  character that is odd number of time is present
  1 number of time or less than this then this
  is odd
* But if the odd count number of character is
  present in the string then it must be happen
  at the odd number number of time
* So any one is hapen at here, then the first
  will win
* Other wise second will be win
